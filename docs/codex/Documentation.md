# Documentation

This file is the live status log and shared memory for future Codex loops.

## Current Status

- Date: 2026-06-13
- Workflow status: `docs/codex/` is the Codex source of truth for project spec, execution order, operating rules, and resume context. After a successful run, Codex should commit and push the completed slice by default.
- Project status: Phases 1 through 7 are complete at the repository behavior and
  test-contract level. The active long-horizon implementation target is now the
  v1 local reader flow: robust long-document orchestration, model-management
  UX, Windows-friendly service setup, and Chrome extension installability.
- Runtime context: the intended end platform is Windows. Codex sessions may run from Windows PowerShell or WSL, so commands and docs should avoid assuming only one shell.
- Current loop result: The first v1 model-management UX slice added
  `tts model-install --activate`, so first-run setup can install a catalog model
  and set it as `[tts].default_voice` in one local command. Install output now
  includes checksum verification status, installed file count, and next-step
  guidance.
- Validation status for the current loop:
  - `py -3 -m ruff check .` passed.
  - `py -3 -m pytest -q` passed with 95 tests.
  - `py -3 scripts/check_extension.py` passed, including resume-wiring checks,
    with JavaScript syntax checks skipped because `node` is not installed.
- Tooling status:
  - `python3 scripts/smoke_service.py --token-file config/token.txt` passed against a live local service.

## What Is Done

- Repo guidance, config loading, voice registry, backend abstraction, and service bootstrap exist.
- Stable localhost HTTP endpoints exist for health, voices, sync TTS, async jobs, job status, job cancellation, and job result retrieval.
- Token auth, token rotation, origin filtering, rate limiting, and localhost security baselines exist.
- WebSocket streaming exists with JSON control events and binary PCM16 frames.
- Observability, CLI tooling, benchmark modes, and audio regression tests exist.
- Chrome MV3 prototype work exists in `apps/chrome_extension/`.
- Phase 7 work already completed includes backend runtime config (`stub` / `auto` / `real`), manifest-side backend asset binding, more truthful backend readiness, health backend snapshots, fake-runtime coverage for sync/jobs/streaming, async job benchmarking, and a first chunk-planning component shared across sync/jobs/streaming.
- Early v1 model-management work now includes local catalog listing, model
  artifact install with optional checksum verification, safe zip extraction
  against absolute paths, drive-qualified paths, and traversal entries, manifest
  update, default voice activation in `config/config.toml`, and model removal.
- A new public-contract smoke script now exists:
  - `scripts/smoke_service.py` exercises `health`, `voices`, sync TTS, WebSocket streaming, and async jobs in one run.
  - `apps/tts_service/tests/test_smoke_script.py` verifies the smoke script orchestration with mocked public-contract clients.
- Milestone 1 is now complete:
  - `ChunkPlanner` can split long sentence-level segments at clause boundaries before the hard max when that produces a better early chunk.
  - oversized segments without clause punctuation now fall back to whitespace-aware hard-limit splitting.
  - split subchunks are kept explicit instead of being immediately merged back into a larger chunk.
  - tests now cover core chunk-boundary behavior plus service-level use of the shared chunk-planning entry point.
- Milestone 2 is now complete at the service layer:
  - `SynthesisService` streams through `backend.synthesize_stream()` instead of synthesizing WAV per planned chunk and slicing decoded PCM locally.
  - service streaming now remaps backend-local chunk indices into one global stream index sequence across the whole chunk plan.
  - service streaming validates sample-rate/channel consistency across streamed backend chunks.
  - regression coverage now fails if stream execution falls back to `backend.synthesize()` instead of the backend streaming contract.
- Milestone 3 is now complete at the service-contract level:
  - cancelling a queued or running job records terminal `cancelled` state immediately.
  - background job completion cannot overwrite a previously cancelled job with `completed`.
  - chunk-planned sync/job synthesis checks backend cancellation flags between planned chunks.
  - WebSocket cancellation raised from the stream generator is reported as a `cancelled` event.
  - synthesis observability now separates cancelled attempts from failures.
- Milestone 4 is now complete:
  - `docs/backend_model_setup.md` documents runtime files, backend modes,
    readiness behavior, manifest conventions, real `sherpa-onnx` backend config,
    catalog format, model-management CLI usage, long-text implications,
    cancellation limits, security notes, and troubleshooting.
  - `README.md` links to the backend/model setup guide from the CLI section.
- Milestone 5 is now complete:
  - the remaining Phase 7 streaming item is implemented through
    callback-driven real-runtime streaming when supported by `sherpa_onnx`;
  - the remaining Phase 7 real-backend cancellation item is implemented through
    generation callbacks that return `0` once cancellation is observed;
  - older runtimes and work between callback boundaries remain documented
    best-effort limits rather than hidden guarantees;
  - `TASKS.md`, `TESTING.md`, `README.md`, `docs/backend_model_setup.md`, and
    `docs/codex/Plan.md` now point future work toward v1 reader slices instead
    of stale Phase 7 execution.
- V1 reader track has started:
  - `tts.max_chars_per_stream` defaults to `48000` and is validated to stay at
    least as large as `tts.max_chars_per_request`.
  - WebSocket streaming now uses `prepare_stream_request()` with the stream
    limit, while HTTP and async jobs still use `prepare_request()`.
  - the Chrome extension page capture default is now `24000` characters, with a
    maximum of `48000`, matching the service's default stream ceiling.
  - tests cover stream acceptance above the HTTP/job limit and rejection above
    the stream limit.
  - stream events now expose `progress` metadata with planned text chunk count,
    completed text chars, and percent complete.
  - WebSocket start events now accept `start_text_chunk_index`, giving future
    extension UX a stable resume anchor.
  - the extension offscreen player stores stream progress in playback state and
    the popup displays it.
  - the popup now exposes `Resume Page`; background resume reuses the latest
    planned text chunk index and re-extracts current active-tab page text.
  - `scripts/check_extension.py` now validates the structural resume wiring even
    when `node` is not installed.
- V1 model-management UX has started:
  - `tts model-install --activate` updates the manifest and `config/config.toml`
    default voice in one command.
  - model install JSON output now reports installed file count, checksum
    verification status, warnings for missing checksums, and next steps.
- This Codex memory structure is now in place:
  - `docs/codex/Prompt.md`
  - `docs/codex/Plan.md`
  - `docs/codex/Implement.md`
  - `docs/codex/Documentation.md`

## What Is Next

- Continue the Post-Phase 7 v1 reader track from `Plan.md`.
- Continue v1 model-management with clearer catalog-list output and install
  progress/status messages.
- Then move to Windows-friendly service setup and Chrome extension
  onboarding/installability.

## Decisions Made And Why

- `docs/codex/` is now the Codex-oriented source of truth so future loops do not have to rediscover scattered instructions.
- `AGENTS.md` remains the entry point for repo rules, but it now points directly to the four Codex workflow files.
- Later phase trackers were treated as stronger than older summary docs when they conflicted.
- Existing legacy docs were mostly left in place as reference material to avoid disruptive rewrites.
- Windows is now recorded explicitly as the final target platform so future loops do not overfit to the current WSL development environment.
- Windows runner fallback is now documented in `AGENTS.md` because some Windows
  sessions resolve `python3` to the Microsoft Store alias.
- A repo-native smoke script was added because long-running Codex loops benefit more from one deterministic public-contract check than from repeated manual `tts` and benchmark commands.
- The chunk-plan improvement was implemented inside `ChunkPlanner` only, without changing public API schemas or service orchestration, so sync/jobs/streaming continue to share the same `prepare_request` entry point.
- This loop stayed focused on the Milestone 2 streaming architecture slice and did not start Milestone 3, even though the user allowed "more if you think you can handle it", because the repo runbook prefers validated milestone-sized slices over bundling unrelated behavioral changes.
- The service now uses the backend streaming contract as its primary streaming
  path. Real runtimes with generation callbacks can emit callback audio;
  stub mode and older runtimes still generate a full PCM buffer before chunk
  emission.
- Cancellation is terminal and observable at the service-contract level. Real
  runtimes with generation callbacks can stop at callback boundaries; hard
  interruption inside a callback interval remains best-effort.
- The real `sherpa_onnx` runtime callback API is feature-detected rather than
  assumed. Supported runtimes stream callback audio and can stop at callback
  boundaries; unsupported runtimes fall back to full-buffer generation while
  preserving public contracts.
- Long page playback should use WebSocket streaming with
  `tts.max_chars_per_stream` instead of raising `tts.max_chars_per_request` for
  every endpoint. This keeps sync HTTP and async job memory/latency expectations
  bounded while allowing the browser reader to handle page-scale text.
- Reader progress should stay tied to planned text chunks, not audio frame
  counts, because audio frame counts vary by backend/runtime while planned text
  chunks are stable enough to support resume UX.
- Extension resume should re-extract active-tab text and reuse the latest
  planned text chunk index instead of persisting raw page text in extension
  storage.
- First-run model setup should prefer one clear local command where possible:
  `tts model-install <id> --catalog <catalog> --activate`.
- Under the current Codex sandbox, some service tests that depend on local socket/network capabilities needed unsandboxed execution to validate correctly. The repo itself passed once run without those sandbox limits.
- Because this repository is jointly owned by the user and Codex, successful
  Codex runs now default to committing and pushing the completed slice. Codex
  should still stop before pushing when validation fails, credentials are
  missing, branch/remote state is unsafe, or the user explicitly says not to.
- This loop intentionally reordered one v1-enabling model-management slice
  ahead of Phase 7 Milestone 3 because the user restated the product goal as a
  local server plus Chrome reader for long web content; a usable voice install
  path is a prerequisite for that end state.

## Commands To Run And Smoke Test

Baseline validation:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 -m ruff check .
```

Service start:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev_run.py
```

Public-contract smoke commands after the service is running:

```bash
tts health
tts list-voices
tts save "Hello world" --out out.wav --token "$TTS_PLATFORM_TOKEN"
tts stream "Hello world" --out stream.wav --token "$TTS_PLATFORM_TOKEN"
tts catalog-list --catalog ./models/catalog.json
tts model-install <model-id> --catalog ./models/catalog.json
tts model-activate <model-id>
tts model-remove <model-id>
python3 scripts/smoke_service.py --token "$TTS_PLATFORM_TOKEN"
python3 scripts/smoke_service.py --token-file config/token.txt
python3 scripts/benchmark.py --mode http --token "$TTS_PLATFORM_TOKEN"
python3 scripts/benchmark.py --mode stream --token "$TTS_PLATFORM_TOKEN"
python3 scripts/benchmark.py --mode job --token "$TTS_PLATFORM_TOKEN"
```

Extension structural smoke:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_extension.py
```

## Known Issues And Follow-Ups

- `README.md` previously presented a Phase 6 status snapshot, while `TASKS.md` and the Phase 7 notes showed additional completed work. The new Codex docs treat the later Phase 7 sources as stronger.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` still describes a much earlier architecture snapshot centered on Phase 2. Use it as background only.
- The original design doc uses `kokoro-en-heart` in examples, but the current manifest and config example use `sherpa-en-debug`.
- Older loops ran in WSL, but future code and docs should not assume WSL or
  Windows PowerShell exclusively.
- Some sessions run in Windows PowerShell instead of WSL; use `py -3` when
  `python3` resolves to the Windows Store alias.
- Real-runtime streaming now uses `sherpa_onnx` generation callbacks when the
  installed package supports them. Stub mode and older real runtimes still use
  full-buffer generation followed by local chunk emission.
- Running-work cancellation can now stop supported real runtimes at generation
  callback boundaries. Hard interruption inside one callback interval remains a
  backend/runtime limitation.
- The default example config still points at the development stub voice. A real
  local voice must be installed and activated before real acoustic output is the
  normal local run path.
- Long page playback now has a larger WebSocket text limit, stream progress
  metadata, and a basic popup resume action. It still lacks section navigation
  semantics.
- The browser prototype still depends on manual Chrome loading and manual allow-list setup.
- There is still no full automated MV3 test harness in the repository.
- `python3 scripts/check_extension.py` still cannot perform JavaScript syntax checks in this environment because `node` is not installed.

## Resume Instructions For The Next Codex Loop

1. Open `docs/codex/Prompt.md`, `docs/codex/Plan.md`, and `docs/codex/Implement.md`.
2. Check this file for current status and any newly recorded blockers.
3. Start with the Post-Phase 7 v1 reader track unless this file records a
   deliberate reorder.
4. Keep the next diff narrowly scoped to that milestone.
5. Run the milestone validation commands before claiming completion.
6. Update this file again before handing off.
